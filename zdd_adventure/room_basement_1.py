# Slowly {game.name} stands up. Since the room is so extremely dark, it's very clever to try to turn on the light.
# As always, the light switch is near the door. {game.name} still needs much longer than usual for the short way.
# Completely understandable, considering its condition.
# {game.name} stands with wobbly legs in front of the light switch and presses the switch.

# ......[click]...........


# {game.name} is lucky.
# It seems like the power is working without a band, as the room is now shining in a rather bright light.

# At first {game.name} looks around slowly.
# {game.name} getÂ´s an idea. Maybe there are more clues on the desk....
# So {game.name} starts walking slowly to the teachers desk.
# When {game.name} arrives at the desk, he finds an almost empty desk. There are only the following items on the desk.

#     -> A water bottle that has been started
#     -> A cross screwdriver
#     -> A pack of colored board markers

#     However, {game.name} only has room for one item.
# '''

# text_pattern_1 = f'''
# {game.name} open their eyes very slow. All {game.name} can see is a blurred dark room.
# After a certain amount of time {game.name} is able to find out where he is currently located.
# {game.name} is in the middle of his old lecture hall and {game.name} is really confused. {game.name} no longer understands
# the world.
# Why should {game.name} wake up in the old lecture hall of his old university?
# For {game.name} this all makes no sense.
# No matter how hard their tries to remember, {game.name} doesn't remember anything at all.

# {game.name} is just trying to keep calm and think about what
# options he has to find out what happened...
