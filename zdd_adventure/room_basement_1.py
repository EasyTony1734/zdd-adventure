def search_light_switch():

    Slowly {game.name} stands up. Since the room is so extremely dark, it's very clever to try to turn on the light.
    As always, the light switch is near the door. {game.name} still needs much longer than usual for the short way.
    Completely understandable, considering its condition.
    {game.name} stands with wobbly legs in front of the light switch and presses the switch.

    ......[click]...........


    {game.name} is lucky.
    It seems like the power is working without a band, as the room is now shining in a rather bright light.

    At first {game.name} looks around slowly.
    {game.name} getÂ´s an idea. Maybe there are more clues on the desk....
    So {game.name} starts walking slowly to the teachers desk.
    When {game.name} arrives at the desk, he finds an almost empty desk. There are only the following items on the desk.

        -> A water bottle that has been started
        -> A cross screwdriver
        -> A pack of colored board markers

        However, {game.name} only has room for one item.

def leave_room():

        {game.name} has left the lecture hall and is now standing in the corridor.
        {game.name} is just standing there, wondering what to do next.

    {game.name} open their eyes very slow. All {game.name} can see is a blurred dark room.
    After a certain amount of time {game.name} is able to find out where he is currently located.
    {game.name} is in the middle of his old lecture hall and {game.name} is really confused. {game.name} no longer understands
    the world.
    Why should {game.name} wake up in the old lecture hall of his old university?
    For {game.name} this all makes no sense.
    No matter how hard their tries to remember, {game.name} doesn't remember anything at all.

    {game.name} is just trying to keep calm and think about what
    options he has to find out what happened...
